# 9gag-autoscroll

### Building

We are using `webpack` in order to have our code nicely organized into modules.

Make sure that you have `webpack` installed.

    sudo npm -g install webpack

Run `webpack` in order to build `dist/9gag-autoscroll.js` file, which contains all the code for the autoscroller.

You can also run `webpack --watch` to have it watch for changes.
